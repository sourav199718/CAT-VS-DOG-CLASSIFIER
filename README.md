CAT-VS-DOG-CLASSIFIER
Overview
Welcome to the CAT-VS-DOG-CLASSIFIER repository! This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is designed to learn and distinguish between these two classes based on patterns and features in the input images.

Key Features
Convolutional Layers: Utilizes convolutional layers for feature extraction from input images.
Batch Normalization: Enhances training stability and accelerates convergence.
Max-Pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions, capturing hierarchical features.
Dropout: Mitigates overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
Binary Classification: Final layer with sigmoid activation for binary cat/dog classification.
