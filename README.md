CAT-VS-DOG-CLASSIFIER
Overview
Welcome to the CAT-VS-DOG-CLASSIFIER repository! This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is designed to learn and distinguish between these two classes based on patterns and features in the input images.

Key Features
Convolutional Layers: Utilizes convolutional layers for feature extraction from input images.
Batch Normalization: Enhances training stability and accelerates convergence.
Max-Pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions, capturing hierarchical features.
Dropout: Mitigates overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
Binary Classification: Final layer with sigmoid activation for binary cat/dog classification.


This script defines a Convolutional Neural Network architecture tailored for classifying images of cats and dogs. The convolutional layers learn hierarchical features from the input images, and the dense layers make the final prediction. Batch normalization is applied for better training stability, and dropout layers help prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a fraction of neurons during training.

The model is structured to take advantage of patterns and spatial hierarchies in the input images, gradually reducing spatial dimensions through convolution and pooling operations. The final layer produces a probability (sigmoid activation) indicating the likelihood of the input image belonging to the "cat" class (closer to 0) or "dog" class (closer to 1).

Before using this model, it needs to be compiled with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics, followed by training on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
